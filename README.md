# Simplified LEGv8 ISA CPU


## Description
A 5-stage cpu that can run a simplified LEGV8 instruction set. It supports data forwarding from the execute and memory access stage, and accelerated branches so that branch instructions can be resolved in the reg/dec stage. Delay slots are required after load and branch instructions.



## Features
-Data forwarding

-Accelerated Branches


## Takeaways
This was the first, large computer architecture project that I completed.
